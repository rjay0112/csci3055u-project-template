## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> - History

Kotlin was first released in 2011 by JetBrains, after a year of prior development, and was meant as a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) language.  The motivation for the creation of this language was that the creators felt that there was no other language that had the features they required besides scala, but they wanted something with a faster compile time similar to that of java.

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*triple variable multiplication function* 
```kotlin
fun tripleMultiply(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) {
  println("multiplication of $a * $b * $c is ${a*b*c}")
}

val a=5
val b=4
val c=2
tripleMultiply(a,b,c)
//=>multiplication of 5 * 4 * 2 is 40
```

*Let form*

```clojure
(let [x 10
      y 20]
  (+ x y))
```
