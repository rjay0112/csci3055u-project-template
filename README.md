## About the language

> - History

Kotlin was first released in 2011 by JetBrains, after a year of prior development, and was meant as a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) language.  The motivation for the creation of this language was that the creators felt that there was no other language that had the features they required besides scala, but they wanted something with a faster compile time similar to that of java.  Similar to how Java was named after an island, Kotlin was named after Kotlin Island, by St. Petersburg. 
The language was designed to be strong enogh to be used in industry and is object-oriented.  It is meant to be a better version of Java, but still be interoperable.

The first officially stable release was Kotlin v1.0 on February 15, 2016, meaning any further versions will be aimed to be backwards compatible to this version.

The next version v1.2 was released on November 28, 2017 and the big feature added was the ability to share code between Java Virtual Machine, and Javascript platforms.  
The most recent version v1.3 was released on October 29, 2018, and implemented [coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine), for [asynchronous programming](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2011/03/24/wccsp_asynchronous-programming.aspx), meaning flow control can be passed back and forth between routines.


> - Some interesting features

**Java Interoperablility**

Kotlin offers interoperability with java, with backwards compatibility for Java 6 and 7.  

**Well formed library**

The standard Kotlin Library is small and is aimed at the extensions made to the Java standard library.  This small but precise library reduces runtime overhand, and allows for optimizations that can be specifically aimed at Android development.

**Not everything needs to be in a class**

Kotlin allows users to define objects and functions at the top level, taking away the required function inside of the file name class, a nice addition for quick simple tests

**Open source**

Kotlin is an open source programming language, off of the baseline of the initial build by Jetbrains.
